This is a project that provides multiples solutions to the Travelling-Salesman Problem, there are 3 types of modes:

Mode A: Minimum Spanning Tree
Mode B: Fast TSP: a 2-opt optimization
Mode C: Optimum TSP

The inputs are points that represents coordinates preceding with a number that indicates the total number of points, the output will be the sequence that the points are visited as the TSP route.
